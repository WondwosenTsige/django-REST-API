# Lab: Django REST Framework & Docker

Overview
Use Django REST Framework to create an API, then “containerize” it with Docker.

Feature Tasks and Requirements
Rebuild a custom version of Blog API demo project from scratch.
Replace Blog and Post with your own application and model.
Your model must have at least as many fields as demo’s model.
Your model must have one field that is a foreign key to user.
NOTE: You are not required to build any templates for this lab.
Features - Docker
NOTE Refer to the class demo for built out Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml examples.
